# Source Vault

Raw source bytes are immutable. Normalized models and runtime packs are derived layers.

```
source-vault/
  quran/<source>/<version>/
    raw/<artifact>
    LICENSE.txt
    provenance.json
    sha256.txt
  morphology/<source>/<version>/...
  hadith/<source>/<edition-or-version>/...
  fonts/<source>/<version>/...
  audio-metadata/<source>/<version>/...
```

Never silently replace bytes under an existing version path. A changed upstream file gets a new preserved version even when its filename is unchanged.

The registry in `source-vault/registry.json` is the production gate; directories alone do not imply approval. Normal builds consume the preserved artifact/version, never upstream latest.

## Preservation integrity contract

An unmirrored research candidate may remain metadata-only. Once **any** preserved-snapshot field is populated, the snapshot must be complete: artifact, licence snapshot, provenance, exact byte size, and all three SHA-256 values must be present and internally consistent.

The Source Vault gate validates preserved candidate snapshots before production promotion as well as production-approved snapshots. This prevents research/awaiting-review bytes from drifting silently between acquisition and later review. A preserved candidate still cannot feed a release content builder until its registry status is explicitly promoted to `production-approved`.

Because this repository is project-controlled redistribution infrastructure, a preserved public snapshot must also have verified redistribution permission and explicit modification/attribution flags. If those rights are unresolved, keep the source metadata-only and do not mirror its bytes.

Acquisition tools that write into `source-vault/` must consult the registry **before making any network request**. A source in `awaiting-licence` is not capture-authorized. This prevents a review-only downloader from accidentally turning unresolved third-party rights into a public project-controlled mirror.

A historical review capture can exist without becoming a registered Source Vault dependency. If bytes were captured before a stricter legal gate landed, they are **quarantined**: registry artifact/hash fields stay null, release builders cannot consume them, no new capture is permitted, and an offline verifier may check their integrity only so the project can detect accidental mutation while legal disposition is resolved. File existence alone never implies production approval.

## Production promotion contract

A `production-approved` registry entry fails closed unless the project has a consistent source identity, verified redistribution permission, explicit modification/attribution flags, a project-controlled artifact, a non-empty licence snapshot and provenance file, and hashes that still match all three preserved files.

The gate records and verifies:

- artifact SHA-256 and exact byte size;
- licence snapshot SHA-256;
- provenance-file SHA-256;
- source/version/licence/mirror fields cross-checked between registry and provenance;
- redistribution, modification and attribution permissions cross-checked between registry and provenance;
- the archived licence snapshot path cross-checked between registry and provenance;
- a timezone-aware retrieval timestamp;
- mandatory release rules from `policy/license_policy.json`.

`schemas/source_registry_v1.schema.json` documents the registry shape. `tools/vault_gate.py` remains the executable conditional authority for production promotion.
