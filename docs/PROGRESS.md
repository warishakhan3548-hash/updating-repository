# Aaris Quran — persistent engineering checkpoint

User direction: native Android Quran comprehension, quiet memory and evidence research;
teal/blue/gold glass UI. Repository main was intentionally cleared at 32d9eef.

## Checkpoint 1: source foundation (2026-09-22)

- Android Java 17 application + portable Java core. Android 8+; no runtime network requirement.
- Original Tanzil Uthmani 1.1 restored from the user's earlier frozen vault, SHA-256 checked.
- Amiri Quran font from its official project; original OFL included.
- Source-tagged English/Hindi/Urdu word glosses and transliteration from a pinned Data Quran snapshot.
  Non-commercial preview only. Upstream source assertions are preserved; this is not an independent
  scholarly review or a commercial rights clearance.
- Deterministic SQLite builder preserves original ayah text including prefatory basmala.
  Strict per-ayah Arabic alignment; mismatched glosses are withheld, never guessed.
- All 114 surahs / 6,236 ayah coordinates validated.
