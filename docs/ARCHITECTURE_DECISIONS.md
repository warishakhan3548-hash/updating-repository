# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001 — Two databases
Use replaceable read-only `content.sqlite` packs and a separate `user.sqlite` for precious personal state. Content upgrades must not endanger years of learning history.

## ADR-002 — Evidence vs Learning planes
Immutable source-faithful assertions are structurally separated from derived learning aids, glosses and AI outputs.

## ADR-003 — Event-preserving learning
Exposure and review logs are append-only. Scheduler state is a projection. FSRS is an adapter, not a permanent schema dependency.

## ADR-004 — Local deterministic retrieval
SQLite is the baseline. Evaluate FTS5/BM25 and trigram/custom Arabic lanes before adding heavier search dependencies.

## ADR-005 — No critical Quran Foundation API dependency
Current Quran Foundation developer terms make the API unsuitable as this project's permanent mirrored foundation. It may remain an optional integration where its terms are satisfied.

## ADR-006 — 48dp Android interaction floor
Important Android controls target at least 48dp touch areas. Inline Arabic word hit regions may expand semantically without visually increasing inter-word spacing.

## ADR-007 — Signed content updates when distribution exists
Use TUF-style version, hash, signature and rollback principles rather than ad-hoc URL replacement, while keeping implementation minimal until real downloadable packs exist.
