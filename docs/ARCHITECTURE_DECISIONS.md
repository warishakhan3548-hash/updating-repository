# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001 — Two databases
Use replaceable read-only `content.sqlite` packs and a separate `user.sqlite` for precious personal state. Content upgrades must not endanger years of learning history.

## ADR-002 — Evidence vs Learning planes
Immutable source-faithful assertions are structurally separated from derived learning aids, glosses and AI outputs.

## ADR-003 — Event-preserving learning
Exposure and review logs are append-only. Scheduler state is a projection. FSRS is an adapter, not a permanent schema dependency.

## ADR-004 — Local deterministic retrieval
SQLite is the baseline. Evaluate FTS5/BM25 and trigram/custom Arabic lanes before adding heavier search dependencies.

## ADR-005 — No critical Quran Foundation API dependency
Current Quran Foundation developer terms make the API unsuitable as this project's permanent mirrored foundation. It may remain an optional integration where its terms are satisfied.

## ADR-006 — 48dp Android interaction floor
Important Android controls target at least 48dp touch areas. Inline Arabic word hit regions may expand semantically without visually increasing inter-word spacing.

## ADR-007 — Signed content updates when distribution exists
Use TUF-style version, hash, signature and rollback principles rather than ad-hoc URL replacement, while keeping implementation minimal until real downloadable packs exist.

## ADR-008 — Runtime packs cannot outrun Source Vault trust
A runtime content pack may only reference a `production-approved` Source Vault entry. CI cross-checks the pack's source ID, version, vault path, source hash and licence against the registry, then verifies the built artifact's own hash and byte size. `approved` packs require signature metadata. This turns provenance from documentation into an executable release boundary.

## ADR-009 — Ayah-only Quran core until morphology passes the Source Vault gate
The first Quran core stores source-faithful ayah evidence and derived search lanes only. It does not manufacture canonical token, segment, lexeme or morphology identities by whitespace splitting. Word-level linguistic identities wait for a legally compatible morphology source that independently passes the Source Vault gate and mapping invariants.

## ADR-010 — Runtime attribution is derived from preserved evidence
For a source whose preserved artifact embeds its required notice, the runtime pack derives its notice from that pinned artifact rather than a separately hand-maintained paraphrase. Provenance attribution and source URL are bound into runtime metadata. Pack artifacts and notices must resolve inside their own immutable manifest directory so one pack cannot borrow another pack's evidence or notice by path or symlink.

## ADR-011 — Phase 1 Android reader consumes one verified pack, not copied evidence
The Android reader packages the existing `quran-core` version directory as assets by reference. On first use it copies the SQLite artifact into an app-private versioned pack directory, verifies its pinned SHA-256 and size before activation, verifies runtime pack metadata, and opens it read-only. The reading UI selects `original_text` only. This avoids a second untracked Quran copy and keeps runtime evidence bound to the same immutable pack manifest that CI validates.

## ADR-012 — Core reader has no direct network capability
The initial Android manifest intentionally declares no `INTERNET` or `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission. Quran reading must remain functional from the bundled verified pack. Later audio, content-update and external-AI networking must be explicit replaceable capabilities rather than hidden dependencies of the reader. An explicit source link may be handed to an external browser without granting the reader network access.
